           <h5>Our Story</h5>
           <div class="h-3"></div>
            <p> Our education story, like many education stories, keeps with the throughline of nontraditional. Concluding our 
                first year of undergrad at Suffolk County Community College we would transfer schools and leave our hometown of 
                Bay Shore. In pursuit of a fine arts degree in musical theater we found ourself in a rural village eight hours North, 
                from the suburbs of Long Island to New York's rust belt. Living in this region of the country challenged the way we knew 
                and now view American cultural racism. Through coursework and our everyday encounters, we slowly gained the neccesary 
                tools to understand this: there is multiplicity in truth.<br><br>

                After graduating from SUNY Fredonia with our BA in English, we began graduate coursework at Columbia University 
                in the City of New York. It was here where we continued our fieldwork at an intersection of psychohistory and social 
                studies education, having developed a person-centered keyword research and analysis methodology. <i>Discussions By 
                Defintion</i> simplifies the oral telling and digital archiving of information, and makes the theorizing 
                and communicating of its findings more accessible. In March of 2021 we graduated from the first 
                accredited oral history program in the United States with our MA in Oral History.<br><br>
                
                When we're not researching or writing, we like to think we're a freelance audiobook narrator who loves running 
                through trails, reading memoirs, drinking our water and minding our business. We can respect a good liquid fast, 
                fresh alkaline fruits, and a warnted homemade (cheat day) choaclate cake. We now split our time between New York 
                and Atlanta.<br><br>
                
                <h5>Our Approch</h5>

                We like to view our work not as didactic but holistic. What does that mean? Well, our personal goal is 
                to level up so much that our view panoramic, experience the Whole picture, rather than just teach parts 
                of the sum. Our aural thesis was an attempt to unpack how language aquisition and 
                natural-language processing systems play into how we, as people (Black Brown Yellow Red White Blue 
                and Otherwise), engage race relations in the 21st century digital age. We also discuss the role of 
                instructional design frameworks, like machine learning and deep learning methodologies, that can 
                motivate youth and ourselves to better cope with and navigate through the 
                discomfort.<br><br>
                
                Our past training as a performing arts student and voice actor heavily inform how we design our instructional 
                design projects: offering consideration first and formost to (1) personality, (2) positionality and (3) 
                personhood of character; then, paying attention to historical context and the essence of world building; and 
                later, narrative analysis of how it <i>all</i> correlates to the Whole.<br><br>


                <h5>Our Vision</h5>

                We work tirelessly to ensure our main idea aligns with the development and articulation of just, equitable, 
                and person-centered strategies, technologies, media, scholarship, and artwork, with specical empahsis on the 
                neccesities for our society’s more vulnerable populations. The answer is always love, as is everything. In 
                this pursuit, sponsored by the KeyAndre, we began a public research initive titled A View Through Them.<br><br>

           <h5>This is their story, how they see it.</h5>

           <div class="h-5"></div>
            <p>Maybe you've heard this idea before: that so much of what we are taught is filtered through a predominately 
                Eurocentric lens, usually not an Indigenous or an African one. We agree, some of the narratives that have been 
                recorded and preserved through generations are accompained by half truths and unquestioned assumptions ... <br><br>

                Expressions of the Indigenous, African, or most broadly people of color, were and still are, to a certain extent, 
                historically cast aside in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and other artistic related 
                scholarship. A View Through Them, stylized as AVTT, finds its purpose in recognizing the perspectives often 
                underrepresented, misrepresented or, all together, not made available by conventional Western archives, 
                academic libraries and classical canons.<br><br>
                
                We commit ourselves to responsibly involving narratives from the Indigenous and African diaspora in our artistic 
                endevours. What are the experiences and the stories <i>they</i> want to glean from, learn about, and keep... the 
                stories that resonate with them. And while this initiative works diligently to prioritize, honour and protect 
                the diverse authenticity of humankind’s oral traditions, it also acts as a reminder of the values, concerns, 
                and precieved vulnerabilities we people―the land, trees, and animals, too―share.<br><br>
