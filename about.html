           <h5>Our Story</h5>
           <div class="h-10"></div>
            <p> My education story, like many education stories, kept with the throughline of nontraditional. Concluding my first year of undergrad at Suffolk County Community College I would transfer schools and leave my hometown of Bay Shore. In pursuit of a fine arts degree in musical theater I relocated to a rural village eight hours North, from the suburbs of Long Island to the rust belt of New York. Living in this region of the country changed the way I knew and now view American cultural racism. Through my coursework and everyday encounters I was quickly introduced to the reality of multiplicity in truth.<br><br>

                After graduating from SUNY Fredonia with my B.A. in English, I began graduate coursework at Columbia University, continuing my fieldwork at an intersection of psychohistory and social studies education. It was here where I theorized a person-centric, keyword research and analysis methodology. <i>Discussions By Defintion</i> simplifies the oral telling and synthesizing of information, and makes the codifiying and communicating of its findings more accessible. In May of 2020, I earned my M.A. in Oral History from the first accredited oral history program in the United States.<br><br>
                <h5>Our Approch</h5>

                I like to see my work not as didactic but holistic. My aural thesis looked at the role language aquisition plays in how we as people, black brown yellow red white blue and otherwise, engage race relations in K-12 education settings, as well as how we'll motivate our youth to cope with and navigate through the discomfort. Generally speaking, my academic research is influenced by my commitment to the expansion of innovative and evidence-based technologies. And my past training as a performing arts student and voice actor, informs how I design and approach my sociology projects: Giving credit first to positionality, personality, and personhood of each character; then paying attention to historical context and the essence of world building; and lastly, consideration to narrative analysis and how it all co-relates.<br><br>

                In the corporate world, I have experience as a mixed methods researcher and education consultant. While studying in New York City I was the graduate assistant with Humanities New York, a non-profit state partner of the National Endowment for the Humanities, where I worked alongside executives, fellow designers, anthropologists, philosophers, and economists to strengthen the traditions of cultural literacy, critical inquiry, and civic engagement. I'd go on to work as Grants Assistant and now Podcast Strategist, where I collaborate with a variety of stakeholders including designers, engineers and product managers to inspire empathetic and elegant end-to-end design solutions. I’ve since grown an understanding of our brand, who our users are and how they listen across segments, roles, industries, etc. <br><br>

                <h5>Our Mission</h5>

                My main idea is to inform the development and preservation of just, equitable, and human-centered strategies, design, media, scholarship, and artwork that reflect the most honest knowledges and needs of our society’s vulnerable populations. My central objective is to create quality educational environs guided by active, person-centered teaching and learning, and to facilitate consciousness-raising conversations amongst engineers, educators, academics and the youth. In this pursuit, I founded a public sociology practice and research center, KeyAndre & Company.<br><br>

                When I’m not researching or writing, I’m a freelance audio book narrator who loves wandering through trails, reading memoirs, drinking my water and minding my business. <br><br>

           <h5>Our Vision</h5>
           <div class="h-5"></div>
            <p>In late autumn of 2017, ten undergraduate students, myself included, set out to produce a documentary project. Instead, we had envisioned something more far-reaching. Founded on a mission to encourage “self-awareness, self-discipline and self-care, through the art of design, rhetoric and rehabilitation,” the group would later be called the KeyAndre & Company. This extracurricular activity turned "lifestyle brand" provided me the room to shape and distribute educational programming for listeners like yourself.<br><br>

                KeyAndre & Company (d.b.a KeyAndre) acts as a research center and data distribution company. We curate educational experiences with youth in mind, specializing in preserving and providing access to oral recordings from the Indigenous and African diaspora.<br><br>
                
                As a public, multicultural-education practice we also provide need-based enrichment services like personal development coaching, homeschooling tools and resources, and project management consultation. We work with our clients as we do with our colleagues: Aware we are each the learner and educator always, in all ways. We hope to expand their literacy capabilities, cultural competency, and leadership skills at every level.<br><br>
