           <h5>Our Story</h5>
           <div class="h-3"></div>
            <p> My education story, like many education stories, keeps with the throughline of nontraditional. Concluding my first year of undergrad at Suffolk County Community College I would transfer schools and leave my hometown of Bay Shore. In pursuit of a fine arts degree in musical theater I found myself in a rural village eight hours North, from the suburbs of Long Island to New York's rust belt. Living in this region of the country changed the way I knew and now view American cultural racism. Through my coursework and everyday encounters I gained tools to understand the reality of multiplicity in truth.<br><br>

                After graduating from SUNY Fredonia with my B.A. in English, I began graduate coursework at Columbia University. It was here where I continued my fieldwork at an intersection of psychohistory and social studies education, developing a person-centered keyword research and analysis methodology. <i>Discussions By Defintion</i> simplifies the oral telling and synthesizing of information, and makes the theorizing and communicating of its findings more accessible. In May of 2020, I graduated from the first accredited oral history program in the United States with my M.A. in Oral History.<br><br>
                
                When I’m not researching or writing, I’m a freelance audio book narrator who loves running through trails, reading memoirs, drinking my water and minding my business. I now split my time between New York and Atlanta.<br><br>
                
                <h5>Our Approch</h5>

                I like to see my work not as didactic but holistic. My aural thesis looks at the role language aquisition and natural-language processing systems play into how we as people (Black Brown Yellow Red White Blue and otherwise) engage race relations in the 21st century. I also talk about instructional design frameworks, like machine learning and deep learning methodologies, that can motivate youth and ourselves to better cope with and navigate through the discomfort. <br><br>
                
                My academic research is influenced by my facination with ethical artificial intelligence (AI) in education settings, with a particular intrests in innovative, person-centric systems of teaching and leanring. My past training as a performing arts student and voice actor heavily inform how I design my sociology projects: Giving consideration first, to personality, positionality and personhood of character; then, historical context and the essence of world building; and later, narrative analysis of how it all correlates.<br><br>


                <h5>Our Vision</h5>

                My main idea has to inform the development and preservation of just, equitable, and person-centered strategies, technologies, media, scholarship, and artwork, with specical attention to the needs of our society’s vulnerable populations. In this pursuit, I began a public sociology and research initive, A View Through Them.<br><br>

           <h3 class="uppercase">AVTT INITIATIVE </h3>
           <h5>This is their story, how they see it.</h5>

           <div class="h-5"></div>
            <p>Maybe you've heard this idea before: That so much of what we are taught is filtered through a predominately Eurocentric lens, usually not an Indigenous or an African one. I agree, some of the narratives that have been preserved through generations are accompained by half truths and unquestioned assumptions ... <br><br>

                Expressions of the Indigenous, African or most broadly people of color were, and still are, to a certain extent, historically cast aside in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and artistic related scholarship. A View Through Them, stylized as AVTT, works to recognize the perspectives often underrepresented, misrepresented or, all together, not made available by conventional curriculm archives, academic libraries and classical canons.<br><br>
                
                I commit myself to responsibly involving narratives from the Indigenous and African diaspora in my artistic endevours. What are the experiences and the stories they want to glean from, learn about, and keep... the stories that resonate with them. And while this initiative works diligently to honour and protect the diverse authenticity of humankind’s oral traditions, it also acts as a reminder of the values, concerns, and vulnerabilities we humans share.<br><br>
