           <h5>This is their story, how they see it.</h5>
           <div class="h-30"></div>
            <p>Maybe you've heard this idea before: That so much of what we are taught is filtered through a predominately Eurocentric lens, usually not an Indigenous or an African one. The <i>KeyAndre</i> agrees, “some of the narratives that have been handed down through generations are filled with half truths and unquestioned assumptions…” Our next question to you is: Can there be life on Earth without genuine reference to the situation of highly melanated people? <br><br>

                A View Through Them, stylized as AVTT, works to recognize the perspectives often underrepresented, misrepresented or, all together, not made available by conventional archives, academic libraries and classical canons. Expressions of the Indigenous, African or most broadly people of color were, and still are, to a certain extent, historically cast aside in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics as an educational category) and artistic related scholarship. <br><br>
                
                The <i>KeyAndre</i> commits itself to better involve narratives from the Indigenous and African diaspora. The experiences and the stories they want to hear from, learn about, and preserve… the stories that resonate with them. And while this initiative works diligently to honour and protect the diverse authenticity of humankind’s recorded story, it also acts as a reminder of the values, concerns, and emotions we humans share. <br><br>
                
                We at <i>KeyAndre</i> hope the AVTT Initiative will contribute to a more collaborative, theoretical and inclusive dialogue around morality and ethics; the politics of difference and multicultural education; cultural competence amongst our children; the supremacy of mind and the vulnerability of body; the blessings and liabilities of power, accessibility in our future, class and disability.</p>

           <div class="h-50"></div>
            <p>In late autumn of 2017, ten undergraduate students set out to produce a documentary project. Instead, they had envisioned something more far-reaching. Founded on a mission to encourage “self-awareness, self-discipline and self-care, through the art of design, rhetoric and rehabilitation,” the group would later be called the KeyAndre & Company. This extracurricular activity turned lifestyle brand provided Kordell K. Hammond, founder and now Chief Executive Director of Archives and Library Sciences, the room to shape and distribute educational programming for listeners like yourself.<br><br>

                KeyAndre & Company (d.b.a KeyAndre) acts as a research center and data distribution company. We curate educational experiences with youth in mind, specializing in preserving oral story from the Indigenous and African diaspora.<br><br>
                
                As a private, multicultural-education practice we also provide need-based enrichment services like personal development coaching, homeschooling tools and resources, and project management consultation. We work with our clients as we do with our colleagues: Aware we are each the learner and educator always, in all ways. We hope to expand their literacy capabilities, cultural competency, and leadership skills at every level.<br><br>
