            <p> person of color. Anyone that’s not white. To understand the views of Western thinking, as well as our own philsophies, we should first analyze and make meaning of them.               </p>

            <p>educator of color. We're redefining what education looks, feels and sounds like. We speak our life narratives as enactments of resistance and self-definition. Discourse itself becomes agency.</p>

            <p> The power of new values and a new way of thinking, being, and sharing is what we're working at. Our individual consciousness plays a key role in shaping how we experience our collective society. </p>
